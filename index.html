    <h1>The Best Movies According to Deo Ary Anggara</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Evil Dead Rise 2023</h3>
    <p>This is the first movie that truly scared me. From the jump scares and the brutal gore to the intense atmosphere, it made me feel chills all over and even look pale after watching it.</p>
    <h3>The Wild Robot</h3>
    <p>This movie really touched my heart. I was moved by the connection between living creatures and machines, even though they’re different beings. The story felt heartwarming and emotional.</p>
    <h3>Sore: Istri dari Masa Depan 2025</h3>
    <p>Honestly, I felt emotionally exhausted while watching this film — not because it was boring, but because the story was so heartbreaking. The character Sore keeps going back and repeating time just to prevent her husband from having a tragic ending. I think it’s a beautiful film that truly deserves to be in my top three favorites.</p>
